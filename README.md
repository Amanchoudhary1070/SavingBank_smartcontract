my conract stores the adress of the owner using msg.sender and stores it . only the owner of the file 
i.e. whose address is stored in the adrress can only take out the ether stored . but using the deposit function 
anyone can deposite the ether in the account . also i made a function to show amount of ether stored in the 
account .
